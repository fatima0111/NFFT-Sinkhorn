# NFFT-Sinkhorn

Acceleration of the Sinkhorn algorithm for multi-marginal optimal transport with tree and circle structured cost functions. The new algorithm is faster than the usual Sinkhorn algorithm. Numerical examples such as Euler flows and the tree-shaped Barycenter problem illustrate the accuracy of the new algorithm.

## Prerequisites
To run the code the fastsum package has be installed. For more details refer to https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/ and https://github.com/NFFT/nfft. 

#### Make sure that the fastsum package is in the same parent directory the NFFT-Sinkhorn directories.

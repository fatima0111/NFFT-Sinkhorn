# NFFT-Sinkhorn

Acceleration of the Sinkhorn algorithm for multi-marginal optimal transport with tree and circle structured cost functions. The new algorithm is faster than the usual Sinkhorn algorithm. Numerical examples such as Euler flows and the tree-shaped Barycenter problem illustrate the accuracy of the new algorithm.
